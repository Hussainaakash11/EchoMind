# EchoMind — Intelligent Audio Conversation Analyzer  
[![GitHub Repo](https://img.shields.io/badge/repo-EchoMind-blue)](https://github.com/Hussainaakash11/EchoMind.git)

> **Bring intelligence to your conversations** — EchoMind turns raw audio into structured, actionable insights.

---

## 📌 Overview  
EchoMind is an **AI-powered system** that processes MP3 audio files, extracts transcripts, performs **deep conversational analysis**, and generates **structured, downloadable reports**.  
It leverages **Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR)**, **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**, and **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** to deliver meaningful insights from spoken conversations.

---

## ✨ Key Features  
- 🎙️ **Automatic Transcription** using Whisper / Faster-Whisper.  
- 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 **Speaker Diarization** – identify *who said what*.  
- 🎭 **Sentiment & Tone Analysis** per speaker.  
- 📝 **Topic Segmentation & LLM-based Summaries**.  
- 🔎 **RAG-based Q&A** over transcripts (LangChain + VectorDB).  
- 👥 **Persona-Based Summaries** – Manager, HR, Client perspectives.  
- 📄 **Downloadable Structured Reports** (PDF).

## 🚀 Use Cases  
- 🏢 **Meeting Summarization** (corporate & academic).  
- 👥 **Interview Analysis** for recruitment & HR teams.  
- 🎙️ **Podcast & Webinar Indexing** with search.  
- 📞 **Customer Support Call Analysis** to improve service.  
- ⚖️ **Legal Deposition & Courtroom Recording Analysis**.  
- 🔬 **Research Data Collection** from audio discussions.

---

## 📈 Why It Matters  
- **80% of enterprise data is unstructured** (IBM) — most of it is audio.  
- Manual transcription & analysis are **time-consuming** and **error-prone**.  
- The **speech & voice recognition market** is projected to hit **USD 49.8B by 2030** (CAGR ~18.3%).  

---

## 🧩 Project Outcome  
An **open-source, end-to-end pipeline** for audio analysis that not only transcribes but also extracts insights, enabling **interactive Q&A** and **structured reporting**.
